			I might call her Mommy, but IRL she goes by Maria Alejandra. She cuddles me all the time and always makes sure my food bowl is completely full. *purrs* Oh, yes! I almost forgot! Besides being the best mommy in the whole wide world, she's also a copywriter, proofreader and an editor. She specializes in the creative side of Advertising and Marketing, and volunteers in a non-profit organization called Save a Gato in her spare time. meow   </p>
